🛡️ RevGuard — Fake Review Detection Backend | Walmart Sparkathon 2025
This is the backend for RevGuard, a fake review detection system built using a fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer model, submitted as part of Walmart Sparkathon 2025 under the theme: Retail Cybersecurity / Customer Trust.

RevGuard classifies input reviews as FAKE or GENUINE, and returns a confidence percentage, helping users identify potentially deceptive reviews on e-commerce platforms.

🧠 Model Details
Base Model: roberta-base from HuggingFace

Architecture: Binary classifier with num_labels=2

Output:

prediction: FAKE or GENUINE
confidence: Percentage confidence in prediction
Method:

Review → Tokenizer → RoBERTa → Logits → Softmax → Prediction + % confidence
Example:

{
  "prediction": "FAKE",
  "confidence": 92.73
}
